My own notes on the basics of SQL 

SQL - Structured Query Language is a programming language that lets you create, change, and pull information from, relational databases. It differs from many             programming languages in that     it deals less with algebraic and algorithmic actions, and deals more with declaring sets, and retreiving information               based on type. 

RDB - A relational database is a system of storing information that logs data into one or more tables, made of columns and rows. Each row of these tables will             represent a unique individuals information, while each column while describe an attribute of each individual. Often tiems relational databses employ integrity       rules to make sure that the data stored within them is consistent and correct. This could mean rules like each individual must have their own unique, id             number to identify them (a primary key), or that only one user at a time can change a certain row's data. 

RDBMS - A Relational Database Management System allows users to create, and maintain their own databases. Common among hobbyists and startups are free, open source         RDBMS like MySQL, SQLlite, and PostgreSQL. However large organizations usually opt for third party, vendor supplied versions of SQL, which are mroe secure           and can scale more easily. They will pay companies like Microsoft, and Oracle for their enterprise SQL solutions.
